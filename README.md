# Adobe® Photoshop® CC SDK

Developers can use the SDK to create plug-ins that extend the functionality of Adobe Photoshop CC.

With this SDK, developers can create and enable apps to drive and/or communicate with Photoshop CC (version 17.0.0 or later) via a TCP connection. It’s now possible for developers to create an eBook of Photoshop tutorials that allows users to drive an Action within Adobe Photoshop CC from within the eBook. Or, if you find yourself inspired by an ocean view, use a tablet device to mix the colors you see and send those colors directly back to Photoshop CC without ever leaving the beach. There are so many possibilities, and with the Photoshop Connection SDK, Adobe is opening Photoshop up to the community to bring these, and other scenarios we haven’t even imagined yet to life.
